On March 3, 1969, the United States Navy established an elite school for the top one percent of its pilots. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of aerial combat and to ensure that the handful of students who graduated were the best fighter pilots in the world. They succeeded. Today, the Navy calls it Fighter Weapons School. The flyers call it: TOPGUN.

**Course Description**

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and advanced techniques in digital communications, aiming to equip students with both theoretical and practical expertise. This course involves a combination of lectures and hands-on workshops. Topics include digital signal processing, modulation and coding, error correction techniques, and the architecture of communication systems. Students will explore the design and implementation of communication protocols, engage in spectrum management practices, and analyze the impacts of noise and losses in communication systems.

For the final project, students will design and implement a communication system, incorporating elements such as digital modulations, error correction algorithms, and antenna systems. Utilizing software tools and hardware components, students will simulate real-world scenarios, focusing on optimizing system performance and overcoming practical challenges in signal transmission.
