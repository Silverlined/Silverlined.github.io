## Space Challenges - Outro

It's a counter intuitive idea - space research and engineering make human life on Earth easier.

Things such as water purification, insulation materials, hospital scanners, sports gear, digital cameras, portable PCs were all developed or tremendously improved during preparation for space missions.

I used to neglect the importance of space - look around, people are living miserable on Earth and there are problems that require way more attention than we actually give;
Why would anyone bother working on spacecrafts, satellites, telescopes - technology that looks away and goes outside of Earth's atmosphere.

I found the answers for myself during Space Challenges 2021, where I was one of those few who got to spend a whole month studying about astronomy, physics, meeting bright people, and living in a peacful village in Rhodope mountain.

There's not more I can say other than that I am thankful to EnduroSat for giving me chance to join them in this unique educational program.
Hopefully, as the team envisions, the program and the outcome of it will evolve in something truly remarkable in the following years.
