## Project Definition - Space Challenges

Theoretical knowledge gives you a deeper understanding of a concept through seeing it in the context of understanding the why behind it.
Practical knowledge, on the other hand, can often lead to a deeper understanding of a concept through the act of personal experience.

Building a fully functional ground station was one of the main tasks during Space Challenges 2021. The project aims to establish a successful signal reception from one of EnduroSat's satellites - QMR-KWT.

### Ground Station Requirements


#### Mission
```
Successful reception of data from EnduroSat's QMR-KWT satellite via a SatNOGS ground station over UHF frequency range that captures 2 passes a day.
```
#### Systems
```
1. The system shall be connected to the SatNOGS network
2. A Raspberry Pi shall be used as a SatNOGS client
3. Radio signal shall be processed via an SDR
4. The system shall operate with a SatNOGS Rotator v3 and track orbiting satellites
5. A wide-band LNA shall be integrated into the system to improve signal reception
6. A directional antenna should be build with locally available materials
7. Antenna dimensions should be calculated for UHF
```
#### Subsystems

#### Conclusion

The program of Space Challenges is structured in a way that attempts to build a thorough understanding of space technology and physics that allows the students to perform at an exceptional level.
