# Lecture Notes: Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves

## Basic Definition of Electromagnetic Waves
- **Electromagnetic Waves** are oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation.
- Generated by accelerating charges or oscillating electric currents.
- Capable of propagating through a vacuum as well as through various media.

## Historical Background
- **James Clerk Maxwell**: Formulated the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation through Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric and magnetic fields interact.
- **Heinrich Hertz**: Experimentally validated the existence of electromagnetic waves, thereby confirming Maxwell's theoretical predictions.

## Overview of Electromagnetic Spectrum
- **Electromagnetic Spectrum**: Encompasses all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, ranging from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency gamma rays. 
- Includes segments like:
  - **Radio Waves**: Used for broadcasting and communications.
  - **Microwaves**: Applied in radar, cooking, and satellite communications.
  - **Infrared**: Utilized in thermal imaging and remote controls.
  - **Visible Light**: The portion perceptible by human eyes.
  - **Ultraviolet**: Employed in ultraviolet lamps and sterilization.
  - **X-rays**: Essential in medical imaging.
  - **Gamma Rays**: Used in cancer treatment and nuclear physics.

## Mechanisms of Information Transport via Electromagnetic Waves

### Modulation Techniques
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: Information is conveyed by varying the carrier wave's amplitude.
- **Frequency Modulation (FM)**: Information is embedded by varying the carrier wave's frequency.
- **Phase Modulation (PM)**: Information is encoded by varying the phase of the carrier wave.

### Signal Propagation and Losses

#### Far-Field Approximation
- **Definition and Importance**: A simplified model to understand wave behavior at distances much greater than the wavelength.
- **Derivation**: Simplifies Maxwell's full-wave equations.
- **Conditions**: Valid when the distance from the source is significantly larger than the wavelength.
- **Applications**:
  - **Antennas**: Critical for design and placement decisions.
  - **Propagation Models**: Influences link budget calculations and interference analyses.

### Plane Wave Representation in Far-Field
- **Mathematical Formulation**:

$$
E(\mathbf{r}, t) = E_0 \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \phi)
$$

- **Assumptions**: Propagation in a homogeneous, isotropic, and non-dispersive medium.
- **Physical Interpretation**: Visualizes as uniform plane fronts propagating with consistent wavefront spacing.
- **Application**: Used as an idealized model for analyzing long-distance communication links.

## Properties of Electromagnetic Waves

### Polarization
- **Types of Polarization**: Linear, Circular, Elliptical.
- Plays a crucial role in antenna design and reducing multipath interference.

### Doppler Effect
- **Explanation**: Frequency shift observed when the source or observer is moving relative to each other.
- **Mathematical Derivation**:

$$
f' = f \left( \frac{c + v_r}{c + v_s} \right)
$$

  where $$ f' $$ is the observed frequency, $$ f $$ the emitted frequency, $$ c $$ the speed of light, $$ v_r $$ and $$ v_s $$ the receiver and source velocities respectively.
  
- **Applications**: Used in radars, satellite communications, and velocity sensing.

### Flux Power Law
- **Definition and Explanation**: Describes the relationship between the power flux and physical properties of electromagnetic waves.
- **Application**: Used in wireless power transfer and in radio astronomy to measure energy received from celestial sources.

## Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves

### Nonlinear Effects in Electromagnetic Wave Propagation
- **Common Effects**: Harmonic generation, intermodulation distortion, solitons.
- **Applications**: High-power microwave systems and nonlinear optical fibers.

### Wave Propagation in Various Media
- **Vacuum**: Ideal medium with no attenuation or dispersion.
- **Air**: Minor attenuation due to atmospheric absorption.
- **Water**: Experiences significant attenuation, crucial for underwater communication considerations.

### Confined vs. Free Waves

#### Confined Waves
- **Definition and Characteristics**: Constrained by physical structures like waveguides or coaxial cables.
- **Waveguides and Resonators**: Use boundary conditions to confine and direct electromagnetic waves.

#### Free Waves
- **Definition**: Propagate in unbounded media.
- **Characteristics**: Subject to dispersion relations that influence wavefront and frequency characteristics.

## Multipole Expansion for Electromagnetic Sources

### Multipole Expansion
- **Concept**: Expands complex electromagnetic fields into simpler forms for analytical convenience.
- **Dipole Term**: Focus on dipole given its extensive use in antenna theory and wireless communications.
- **Higher Order Terms**: Briefly touch on quadrupole and higher-order terms, relevant for specialized applications.
