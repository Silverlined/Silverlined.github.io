## Space Challenges 2021 - Week 1

### August, 16
It’s day 1, officially. What should we expect? 

Clear beautiful blue sky, dew on the grass, fresh air. But, first of all, breakfast! 8 a.m, our hosts Zara and Petyo had already prepared delicious food - marudnici (Rhodopean pancakes) and mekitsi (traditional Bulgarian food, which everybody loves) with fruit jam. We had a great time while watching the landscape and talking to each other.

Just after the breakfast we went to our first workshop, called “Space 101: Rockets, Orbits and Satellites”, which, in my humble opinion, only purpose was to rocket down our ego so we can start building our knowledge afresh. :D The workshop was about solving physical problems in space mathematically. Nevertheless, it was interesting to see what we were going to face in the following week. 

We had better also expected our first homework - we received tons of videos and reading materials to watch and read like the NASA CubeSat 101 document and other CubeSat standards like 1-3U and 6U. The teams were not divided yet, which eventually puts us directly in front of the screens to catch up with what we need to learn.

Despite the amount of work, we decided that we want to work on a simulation of a problem that VIktor - the CTO of EnduroSat, a.k.a. the lecturer from the morning workshop, gave us to solve numerically.
